          <h1>Hi, I'm Utkarsh Chhadva! I design, research, write and blog!></h1>
          <p>I was born a genius baby in Mumbai. 26 years later, I flew to the U.S. to study HCIM at the University of Maryland, College Park, only to understand I am no              where close to call myself a master of design. And now, I am currently seeking Summer 2023 internship opportunities to experience in delivering end-to-end                UX/UI designs for software products.</p>
