          <h1>Hi, I'm Utkarsh Chhadva. I design, research, write and blog!</h1>
          <p1>I was born a genius baby in Mumbai. 26 years later, I flew to the U.S. to study HCIM at the University of Maryland, College Park, only to understand I am                 no where close to call myself a master of design. And now, <strong>I am currently seeking Summer 2023 internship opportunities</strong> to experience in   
             delivering end-to-end UX/UI designs for software products.</p1>
             <br>
          <p2>P.S. this website has been entirely coded by me: a first time coder. I am proud of myself :)</p2>
